## General Information
- You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.
- Bike sharing dataset is used for analysis
- Linear regression model is built to study impact of different features on bike sharing demand

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
Linear regression model build with features which are significant in deciding the demand for rental bikes. R-squared value of the model: 0.573        
Significant Features impacting the demand for bike sharing:
i) Temperature â€“ higher the temperature good booking number
ii) LightRain - impacts bike booking negatively
iii) Windspeed - impacts bike booking negatively
